\section*{Research Interests}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

I enjoy investigating how ecological and genetic factors influence the evolutionary process, and \textit{vice versa}.
Recent/ongoing projects use mathematical models to investigate (\textit{i}) the role of sex and epistasis in shaping genetic signatures of evolutionary rescue, (\textit{ii}) the impact of haploid selection on the lability of sex determination systems, (\textit{iii}) the effect of species interactions on evolution and persistence in changing environments, and (\textit{iv}) how non-Mendelian inheritance affects the likelihood of crossing valleys of fitness created by epistasis.
Past projects involved actual fieldwork on real plant communities and wild birds.

%My past research was more empirical: I have helped explore how migration influences hybridization and speciation in the Swainson's thrush and Yellow-rumped warblers, the natural history of the endangered Kittlitz's murrelet in Alaska, plant community succession following wildfire in the boreal forests of Newfoundland, and the evolution of female colouration in a wild population of American redstarts.
